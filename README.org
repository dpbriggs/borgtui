** Features

- *Simple*: Manage your backup sources, backups, and repositories from either the TUI or CLI.
- *Ergonomic*: Find, add, and canonicalize backup paths [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244952253-57126b10-d749-4337-9eb4-d6633ee8e0a5.png][from the TUI]].
- *Concurrent*: All operations occur concurrently and in parallel for each repository.
- *Easy*: Just Worksâ„¢. BorgTUI will backup every source directory to every remote repository.
- *Friendly*: Shell completions, desktop notifications, systemd unit generation.
- *Automation*: Designed to perform regular and scheduled backups.
- *Documentation*: Has man pages and helpful error messages.

** Installation

*** Arch Linux

BorgTUI is available on the AUR as [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/borgtui-git][borgtui-git]].

*** Manual Installation

You can manually install BorgTUI with [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html][cargo]]:

#+begin_src bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dpbriggs/borgtui.git
#+end_src

**** Shell Completion

Shell completions can be enabled by sourcing completions generated by BorgTUI. Replace "zsh" with whatever shell you're using (e.g. "bash"):

#+begin_src bash
source <(borgtui shell-completion --shell zsh)
#+end_src

**** Install Man Pages

Install the man pages at a location with:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui install-man-pages <install_directory_path>
#+end_src

On most systems you can use =manpath= to find where to install those man-pages.

** Quick Start Guide

*** Profiles

BorgTUI supports having several profiles which each contain their own backup sources and borg repositories.
The default profile is called "default" and lives under =~/.config/borgtui/profiles/default.json= on Linux.
You can set =BORGTUI_PROFILE= in your environment or use =borgtui -p <profile_name> ...= to select the profile.

The default screen in BorgTUI is the profile view where you can see your backup paths and repositories:

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244976922-1fbc3393-a4ba-44be-8b2c-31b3cc02b831.png][https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244976922-1fbc3393-a4ba-44be-8b2c-31b3cc02b831.png]]

**** Creating New Profiles

Interacting with BorgTUI will automatically create a profile called "default" unless a different profile is specified.
You can create a new profile with:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui add-profile <profile-name>
#+end_src

*** Initializing or Adding a New Repository

BorgTUI normally retrieves the repository encryption passphrase from your keyring. However, when setting up a new repository
BorgTUI reads the passphrase from the environment or from the command-line with =borgtui (init|add-repo) -e <passphrase> <location>=.
The easiest way is to set =BORG_PASSPHRASE= and you can set this using =read= and pasting in the password followed by enter:

#+begin_src bash
read -s BORG_PASSPHRASE
#+end_src

You'll need to export that variable for BorgTUI to pick it up:

#+begin_src bash
export BORG_PASSPHRASE
#+end_src

If you want to *add an existing* repository, use =borgtui add-repo=:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui add-repo ssh://abcdefg@abc123.repo.borgbase.com/./repo
#+end_src

If you want to *create* a new repository, use =borgtui init=:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui init ssh://david@home-nas/hdd1/borg
#+end_src

*** Adding Sources

You can add new backup sources by using the directory chooser in =borgtui=.
Press "a" to open the directory chooser. Autocomplete and canonicalize paths with "TAB".

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244952253-57126b10-d749-4337-9eb4-d6633ee8e0a5.png][https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244952253-57126b10-d749-4337-9eb4-d6633ee8e0a5.png]]

You can also use =borgtui add= on the command-line:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui add <backup_path>
#+end_src

You can manually add paths by editing the profile json file under =~/.config/borgtui/profiles/=.
Make sure to run that path through =realpath= first!

*** Creating a Backup

You can create a new backup across each repository by pressing "u" when =borgtui= is open.

[[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244974358-5322a8b0-6e0f-4893-ac3d-0b1eeeecacae.png][https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5560032/244974358-5322a8b0-6e0f-4893-ac3d-0b1eeeecacae.png]]

You can also create a backup on the command-line using:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui create
#+end_src

*** Listing Archives

You can list archives in the TUI by hitting "l". You can also list backups by using:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui list
#+end_src

*** Restoring from a Backup

Currently BorgTUI only supports mounting an archive or repository. First you need to select and archive to restore from:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui list
2023-06-11T22:15:31.551471Z  INFO borgtui: /hdd3/NewBackup::real-2023-04-23:14:01:00
2023-06-11T22:15:31.551481Z  INFO borgtui: /hdd3/NewBackup::real-2023-04-23:23:27:23
... truncated ...
#+end_src

The archive =/hdd3/NewBackup::real-2023-04-23:14:01:00= looks good. The repository =/hdd3/NewBackup= is also a good choice.
Let's mount the archive at =~/borg-mount=:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir ~/borg-mount
borgtui mount /hdd3/NewBackup::real-2023-04-23:14:01:00 ~/borg-mount
#+end_src

You can also mount whole repositories:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui mount <repository_name> ~/borg-mount
#+end_src

Your backup should show up in that folder. Ideally use a file manager to browse and restore whatever files you need selectively.
You can unmount a mounted archive or repository by using =borgtui umount=

#+begin_src bash
borgtui umount ~/borg-mount
#+end_src

*** Pruning and Compacting

You can prune by pressing "\" in the TUI or by issuing:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui prune
#+end_src

You can compact a repo by pressing "c" in the TUI or by issuing:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui compact
#+end_src

*** TODO Checking

Right now BorgTUI doesn't support checking so you can do that manually with =borg=. Just set =BORG_PASSPHRASE= in your environment and use

#+begin_src bash
borg check <path_to_repo>
#+end_src

*** Disabling a Repository

To disable a repository so that BorgTUI won't interact with it set the disabled flag in the repository section of the configuration:

#+begin_src json
  "repos": [
    {
      "path": "/path/to/borg/repo",
      "encryption": "Keyring",
      "disabled": true
    },
  ]
#+end_src

To find your profile use the "config-path" subcommand:

#+begin_src bash
borgtui config-path
#+end_src

This is useful to prevent unnecessary errors and logs when you're upgrading your NAS or BorgBase decides to have an extended outage :^)

** Automatic Scheduled Backups

BorgTUI is designed to regularly back up your files.

*** Systemd User Units

BorgTUI contains systemd user unit templates you can use to automate backups. You can install the service and timer with (replace =-default= with your custom profile name if you have one):

#+begin_src bash
borgtui systemd-create-unit --install
borgtui systemd-create-unit --install --timer
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now borgtui-create-default.timer
#+end_src

By default the backup occurs every night at 9PM local time. Edit the timer unit in =~/.config/systemd/user/= to change it to a different date.
BorgTUI will issue a notification that the backup completed.

You can trigger backups manually with:

#+begin_src bash
systemctl --user start borgtui-create-default
#+end_src

You can view logs of past backups with:

#+begin_src bash
journalctl --user -u borgtui-create-default
#+end_src

*** Without Systemd

Simply issue =borgtui create= with the scheduling system of your choosing (cron, etc).

** Known issues

*** Password-based SSH doesn't work and messes up the terminal

I can't find a way to ask SSH to not ask for a password without modifying the actual SSH command used or editing the ssh_config.
I can't do the latter so a refactor would need to occur somewhere between BorgTUI and borg itself.

** Why does this exist?

I wanted a tool to automatically *backup the same set of folders to every repository*.
I couldn't get Vorta to ergonomically backup the same set of folders to several remote repositories ([[https://github.com/borgbase/vorta/issues/942][issue]]).
